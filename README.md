# Annoy your co-workers
This is a silly little script that will download a [cupcake-ipsum](http://www.cupcakeipsum.com/) text file, it waits a random time between 2 and 10 minutes, and then says it using macOS's text to speech. It then repeats.

# Run it:
From your terminal via:

```
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swilliams/voicetime/master/voice.sh | sh
```
